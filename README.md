# Alwayscompare
A mod for Heroes of Hammerwatch 2, sometimes it's annoying to always right click on everytime to compare them.
With this mod the necessity to right click is removed and the items are always compared, even the items found on the ground or in the sarcophagus, just hover over them!

These files are currently overwritten, this means if other mods do the same 1 of the 2/multiple mods will stop working.
